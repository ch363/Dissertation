# Research Documentation

This directory contains research notes, findings, and documentation related to the dissertation project.

## Purpose

The research documentation serves to:
- Capture and organize research findings and insights
- Provide background context for development decisions
- Document literature review and related work analysis
- Track research methodology and experimental results
- Support academic writing and dissertation preparation

## Structure

### Research Areas
- **Literature Review**: Analysis of existing work and research papers
- **Methodology**: Research methods and experimental approaches
- **Requirements Analysis**: System requirements derived from research
- **Technical Investigation**: Technology evaluation and selection
- **Experimental Results**: Data, analysis, and findings from experiments

### Document Types
- **Research Notes**: Daily research activities and findings
- **Literature Analysis**: Detailed analysis of academic papers and sources
- **Technical Reports**: In-depth technical investigations
- **Experiment Reports**: Methodology, data, and results from experiments
- **Decision Records**: Rationale for technical and design decisions

## Research Process

### 1. Literature Review Process
1. **Source Identification**: Find relevant academic papers and sources
2. **Initial Screening**: Quick review for relevance and quality
3. **Detailed Analysis**: Thorough reading and note-taking
4. **Summary Creation**: Key findings and insights documentation
5. **Integration**: Connect findings to research questions and objectives

### 2. Technical Investigation Process
1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly define the technical challenge
2. **Solution Research**: Investigate existing solutions and approaches
3. **Evaluation Criteria**: Define metrics for comparing options
4. **Analysis and Testing**: Hands-on evaluation when possible
5. **Decision Documentation**: Record choice rationale and trade-offs

### 3. Experimental Process
1. **Hypothesis Formation**: Define clear research hypotheses
2. **Experimental Design**: Plan methodology and data collection
3. **Implementation**: Build experimental systems and tools
4. **Data Collection**: Gather experimental data systematically
5. **Analysis and Interpretation**: Analyze results and draw conclusions
