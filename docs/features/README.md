# Feature Specification Framework

This directory contains the feature specification process and templates for systematic feature development.

## Overview

The feature specification framework provides a structured approach to:
- Define feature requirements clearly
- Track feature development progress
- Ensure consistent documentation
- Enable effective stakeholder communication

## Process

1. **Feature Proposal**: Create initial feature specification using the template
2. **Review and Refinement**: Collaborate on requirements clarification
3. **Implementation Planning**: Break down into development tasks
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor development milestones
5. **Validation and Testing**: Verify feature meets requirements

## Templates

- [Feature Specification Template](templates/feature-spec-template.md) - Use this for new feature proposals
- [Feature Review Checklist](templates/review-checklist.md) - Use this for feature reviews
- [Implementation Plan Template](templates/implementation-plan-template.md) - Use this for development planning

## File Naming Convention

- Feature specifications: `FEAT-{ID}-{short-name}.md`
- Implementation plans: `IMPL-{FEAT-ID}-{short-name}.md`
- Review documents: `REV-{FEAT-ID}-{review-number}.md`

## Status Tracking

Features progress through these states:
- **Proposed**: Initial feature idea documented
- **In Review**: Undergoing stakeholder review
- **Approved**: Ready for implementation planning
- **In Development**: Implementation in progress
- **Testing**: Feature complete, undergoing validation
- **Complete**: Feature delivered and validated
- **Deferred**: Feature postponed
- **Rejected**: Feature not approved for implementation

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for sample feature specifications and implementation plans.
